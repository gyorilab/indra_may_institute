This repository provides various notebooks for the course _Interpretation of proteomic experiments in the context of biomolecular networks_ at the
[May Institute on Computation and Statistics for Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics](https://computationalproteomics.khoury.northeastern.edu/).

## Description

Interpreting proteomics data using networks representing cellular mechanisms is a powerful approach to gaining actionable insights. In this repository, we first introduce software for annotating data sets using identifiers, a crucial step to prepare data for analysis. We then learn about the INDRA system which automatically assembles mechanisms into networks from both pathway databases and biomedical literature.  We provide examples of code that allow scientists to gain insights from data and generate hypotheses based on large-scale networks. 

## Goal

This repository aims to foster confidence and stimulate creativity among biological scientists, encouraging them to fully leverage INDRA's database for their research endeavors.
